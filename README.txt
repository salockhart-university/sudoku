Functionality
	The app will load with a Sudoku game, and from there it can be played.  There are 9 numbered buttons at the bottom of the screen that are used to select which number will be placed when tapping on the grid.
	There is also an CLEAR button, which lets you erase entries from the grid.
	The RESET button will start the same game over again.
	The NEW button will start a brand new game.
	Players cannot place a number in space that would break the rules of the game.
	When an invalid number is attempted to be placed, the numbers that are blocking it will flash red.

Bugs
	No known issues.
